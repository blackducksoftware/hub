NOTE:

Customers upgrading from a version prior to 2018.12.0 will experience a longer than usual upgrade time due to a data migration needed to support new features in
subsequent releases. Upgrade times will depend on the size of the Black Duck database. If you would like to monitor the process of the upgrade, please contact
Synopsys Customer Support for instructions.

Customers upgrading from a version prior to 4.2 should contact Synopsys Technical Support for assistance.

Customers upgrading from a version prior to 2022.2.0 will have their PostgreSQL data volume automatically migrated from PostgreSQL 9.6.x to PostgreSQL 11.x.
