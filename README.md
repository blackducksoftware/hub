# Hub Docker Orchestration Files/Documentation

This repository will contain orchestration files and documentation for using the individual Hub Docker containers. 
At the moment only the archives of the orchestration/documentation will be added here. Over the next releases the actual 
content will also live here.

## Location of hub-docker 3.6.2 archive:

# Running Hub in Docker

Currently, there is only docker compose. Docker swarm and docker run will be coming soon. Instructions for running each can be found in:

* docker-compose - Instructions and files for running with Docker Compose

## Requirements

### Docker Version Requirements

Hub has been tested with Docker 1.13.1. 

### Hardware Requirements

This is the minimum hardware that is needed to run a single instance of each container. The sections below document the individual requirements for each container if they will be running on different machines or if more than one instance of a container will be run (right now only Job Runners support this)

* 4 CPUs
* 16 GB RAM (or 15GB if you're constrained running on AWS or other cloud providers)
