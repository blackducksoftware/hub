# Black Duck On Kubernetes/OpenShift
Welcome to the README for Black Duck on Kubernetes/OpenShift.
Please note that this document applies *only* to Black Duck on Kubernetes/OpenShift.  If you wish to deploy or use Black Duck on any other platform such as Docker Swarm, please reference the documentation specific to that platform.
# Deploying Black Duck in Kubernetes/OpenShift
Several approaches are possible to enable deployment of Black Duck using Kubernetes/OpenShift:
1. Helm
A Helm chart is provided to that describes a Kubernetes set of resources required to deploy Black Duck.
2. Synopsysctl
Another approach for installing Black Duck on Kubernetes/OpenShift is to use [Synopsysctl](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BDLM/pages/34373652/Synopsysctl), a cloud-native administration utility that assists in the deployment and management of Synopsys software in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.
Please see the "Black Duck Installation Guide" in the [Synopsysctl documentation](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BDLM/pages/34373652/Synopsysctl) for information about using Synopsysctl to deploy Black Duck in a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
# Technical Resources
For the latest technical information on Black Duck for Kubernetes/OpenShift, see the [wiki](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub/wiki) in this repository.
For the latest technical information on Synopsysctl, see [Synopsysctl documentation](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BDLM/pages/34373652/Synopsysctl).
# Other Resources
Another Kubernetes/OpenShift solution provided by Synopsys is OpsSight Connector, which works with Black Duck to scan containers in your clusters for open-source security vulnerabilities.

Check out the official [OpsSight documentation](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BDLM/pages/34242566/OpsSight) for information about how OpsSight and Black Duck can make your clusters safer.
